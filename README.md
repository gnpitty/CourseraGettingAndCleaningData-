Coursera Getting And Cleaning Data 
===============================

Getting and Cleaning Data course proyect.

The purpose of this project is to collect, work with, and clean a data set. <br>

We  create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:<br>

1- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.;<br>
2- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.<br> 
3- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set<br>
4- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. <br>
5- From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with <br>
the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.<br>


 

The dataset includes the following files.<br>
========================================.<br>

- 'README.txt.<br>

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.<br>

- 'features.txt': List of all features.<br>

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.<br>

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.<br>

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.<br>

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.<br>

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.<br>

The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent..<br>

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30..<br>

- 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis..<br>

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration..<br>

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second..<br>
